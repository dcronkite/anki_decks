Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==It was six men of Indostan
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==To learning much inclined,
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Who went to see the Elephant
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Though all of them were blind,
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==That each by observation
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Might satisfy his mind.
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==The First approached the Elephant
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==And, happening to fall
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Against his broad and sturdy side,
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==At once began to bawl:
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant=="God bless me, but the Elephant
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Is very like a wall!"
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==The Second, feeling the tusk,
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Cried, "Ho! what have we here
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==So very round and smooth and sharp?
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==To me 'tis very clear
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==This wonder of an Elephant
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Is very like a spear!"
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==The Third approached the animal
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==And, happening to take
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==The squirming trunk within his hands,
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Thus boldly up he spake:
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant=="I see," quoth he, "The Elephant
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Is very like a snake!"
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==The Fourth reached out an eager hand,
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==And felt about the knee:
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant=="What most the wondrous beast is like
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Is very plain," quoth he;
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant=="Tis clear enough the Elephant
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Is very like a tree!"
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==The Fifth, who chanced to touch the ear,
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Said, "Even the blindest man
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Can tell what this resembles most;
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Deny the fact who can:
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==This marvel of an elephant
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Is very like a fan!"
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==The Sixth no sooner had begun
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==About the beast to grope
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Then, seizing on the swinging tail
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==That fell within his scope,
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant=="I see," quoth he, "the Elephant
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Is very like a rope!"
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==And so these men of Indostan
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Disputed loud and long,
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Each in his own opinion
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Exceeding stiff and strong.
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Though each was partly in the right,
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==They all were in the wrong!
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==So, oft in theologic wars
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==The disputants, I ween,
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Rail on in utter ignorance
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Of what each other mean,
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==And prate about an Elephant
Saxe==Blind Men and the Elephant==Not one of them has seen!
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==All the world's a stage,
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==And all the men and women merely Players;
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==They have their exits and their entrances,
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==And one man in his time plays many parts,
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==His Acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==Seeking the bubble reputation
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==In fair round belly with good capon lined,
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==Full of wise saws and modern instances;
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==That ends this strange eventful history,
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Shakespeare==All the World's a Stage==Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
Frost==Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening==Whose woods these are I think I know.
Frost==Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening==His house is in the village though;
Frost==Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening==He will not see me stopping here
Frost==Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening==To watch his woods fill up with snow.
Frost==Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening==My little horse must think it queer
Frost==Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening==To stop without a farmhouse near
Frost==Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening==Between the woods and frozen lake
Frost==Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening==The darkest evening of the year.
Frost==Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening==He gives his harness bells a shake
Frost==Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening==To ask if there is some mistake.
Frost==Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening==The only other sound's the sweep
Frost==Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening==Of easy wind and downy flake.
Frost==Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening==The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
Frost==Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening==But I have promises to keep,
Frost==Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening==And miles to go before I sleep,
Frost==Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening==And miles to go before I sleep.
Frost==The Road Not Taken==Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
Frost==The Road Not Taken==And sorry I could not travel both
Frost==The Road Not Taken==And be one traveler, long I stood
Frost==The Road Not Taken==And looked down one as far as I could
Frost==The Road Not Taken==To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Frost==The Road Not Taken==Then took the other, as just as fair,
Frost==The Road Not Taken==And having perhaps the better claim,
Frost==The Road Not Taken==Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Frost==The Road Not Taken==Though as for that the passing there
Frost==The Road Not Taken==Had worn them really about the same,
Frost==The Road Not Taken==And both that morning equally lay
Frost==The Road Not Taken==In leaves no step had trodden black.
Frost==The Road Not Taken==Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Frost==The Road Not Taken==Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
Frost==The Road Not Taken==I doubted if I should ever come back.
Frost==The Road Not Taken==I shall be telling this with a sigh
Frost==The Road Not Taken==Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Frost==The Road Not Taken==Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
Frost==The Road Not Taken==I took the one less traveled by,
Frost==The Road Not Taken==And that has made all the difference.
Donne==Devotions upon Emergent Occasions==No man is an island, entire of itself;
Donne==Devotions upon Emergent Occasions==every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.
Donne==Devotions upon Emergent Occasions==If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less,
Donne==Devotions upon Emergent Occasions==as well as if a promontory were,
Donne==Devotions upon Emergent Occasions==as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were:
Donne==Devotions upon Emergent Occasions==any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind,
Donne==Devotions upon Emergent Occasions==and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==Because I could not stop for Death –
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==He kindly stopped for me –
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==The Carriage held but just Ourselves –
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==And Immortality.
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==We slowly drove – He knew no haste
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==And I had put away
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==My labor and my leisure too,
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==For His Civility –
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==We passed the School, where Children strove
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==At Recess – in the Ring –
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==We passed the Setting Sun –
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==Or rather – He passed Us –
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==The Dews drew quivering and Chill –
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==For only Gossamer, my Gown –
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==My Tippet – only Tulle –
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==We paused before a House that seemed
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==A Swelling of the Ground –
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==The Roof was scarcely visible –
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==The Cornice – in the Ground –
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==Feels shorter than the Day
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==I first surmised the Horses' Heads
Dickinson==Because I could not stop for Death==Were toward Eternity –
Longfellow==The Tide Rises, the Tide Falls==The tide rises, the tide falls,
Longfellow==The Tide Rises, the Tide Falls==The twilight darkens, the curlew calls;
Longfellow==The Tide Rises, the Tide Falls==Along the sea-sands damp and brown
Longfellow==The Tide Rises, the Tide Falls==The traveller hastens toward the town,
Longfellow==The Tide Rises, the Tide Falls==And the tide rises, the tide falls.
Longfellow==The Tide Rises, the Tide Falls==Darkness settles on roofs and walls,
Longfellow==The Tide Rises, the Tide Falls==But the sea, the sea in the darkness calls;
Longfellow==The Tide Rises, the Tide Falls==The little waves, with their soft, white hands,
Longfellow==The Tide Rises, the Tide Falls==Efface the footprints in the sands,
Longfellow==The Tide Rises, the Tide Falls==And the tide rises, the tide falls.
Longfellow==The Tide Rises, the Tide Falls==The morning breaks; the steeds in their stalls
Longfellow==The Tide Rises, the Tide Falls==Stamp and neigh, as the hostler calls;
Longfellow==The Tide Rises, the Tide Falls==The day returns, but nevermore
Longfellow==The Tide Rises, the Tide Falls==Returns the traveller to the shore,
Longfellow==The Tide Rises, the Tide Falls==And the tide rises, the tide falls.
Milton==Sonnet 19==When I consider how my light is spent,
Milton==Sonnet 19==Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,
Milton==Sonnet 19==And that one Talent which is death to hide
Milton==Sonnet 19==Lodged with me useless, though my Soul more bent
Milton==Sonnet 19==To serve therewith my Maker, and present
Milton==Sonnet 19==My true account, lest he returning chide;
Milton==Sonnet 19==“Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?”
Milton==Sonnet 19==I fondly ask. But patience, to prevent
Milton==Sonnet 19==That murmur, soon replies, “God doth not need
Milton==Sonnet 19==Either man’s work or his own gifts; who best
Milton==Sonnet 19==Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state
Milton==Sonnet 19==Is Kingly. Thousands at his bidding speed
Milton==Sonnet 19==And post o’er Land and Ocean without rest:
Milton==Sonnet 19==They also serve who only stand and wait.”
Carroll==Jabberwocky==’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Carroll==Jabberwocky==Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
Carroll==Jabberwocky==All mimsy were the borogoves,
Carroll==Jabberwocky==And the mome raths outgrabe.
Carroll==Jabberwocky==“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
Carroll==Jabberwocky==The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Carroll==Jabberwocky==Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
Carroll==Jabberwocky==The frumious Bandersnatch!”
Carroll==Jabberwocky==He took his vorpal sword in hand;
Carroll==Jabberwocky==Long time the manxome foe he sought—
Carroll==Jabberwocky==So rested he by the Tumtum tree
Carroll==Jabberwocky==And stood awhile in thought.
Carroll==Jabberwocky==And, as in uffish thought he stood,
Carroll==Jabberwocky==The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Carroll==Jabberwocky==Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
Carroll==Jabberwocky==And burbled as it came!
Carroll==Jabberwocky==One, two! One, two! And through and through
Carroll==Jabberwocky==The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
Carroll==Jabberwocky==He left it dead, and with its head
Carroll==Jabberwocky==He went galumphing back.
Carroll==Jabberwocky==“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Carroll==Jabberwocky==Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
Carroll==Jabberwocky==O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”
Carroll==Jabberwocky==He chortled in his joy.
Carroll==Jabberwocky==’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Carroll==Jabberwocky==Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
Carroll==Jabberwocky==All mimsy were the borogoves,
Carroll==Jabberwocky==And the mome raths outgrabe.
Yeats==Second Coming==Turning and turning in the widening gyre
Yeats==Second Coming==The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Yeats==Second Coming==Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Yeats==Second Coming==Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
Yeats==Second Coming==The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
Yeats==Second Coming==The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
Yeats==Second Coming==The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Yeats==Second Coming==Are full of passionate intensity.
Yeats==Second Coming==Surely some revelation is at hand;
Yeats==Second Coming==Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
Yeats==Second Coming==The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
Yeats==Second Coming==When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Yeats==Second Coming==Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
Yeats==Second Coming==A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
Yeats==Second Coming==A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Yeats==Second Coming==Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Yeats==Second Coming==Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
Yeats==Second Coming==The darkness drops again; but now I know
Yeats==Second Coming==That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Yeats==Second Coming==Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
Yeats==Second Coming==And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Yeats==Second Coming==Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?
